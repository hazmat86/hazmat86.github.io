        <p>So raylib, huh? I've been working on this game I've had in my head for a few days now and I think I'm finally ready to give
            you guys my little opinion on the library, at least from a total n00b's perspective. All in all, raylib is the bee's knees!
            No doubt about it! Yeah it's pretty bare bones and it doesn't hold your hand but that's the appeal of it isn't it? Sit back and
            allow me to elaborate.
        </p>
        <p>So the game I've come to call Code Name: Skwishy is a 3-D platformer/ARPG. Think some unholy abomination/love-child of Diablo and 
            Banjo-Kazooie. If your brain can handle that shit then you're well on your way to understanding exactly what I'm talking about.
            For the rest of you, hang on. So, as you can already tell this game is an odd creation to say the least. I tried a few game engines
            out, and while all had their pros and cons (GO GODOT!), none of them allowed me to capture the feel I really want for the game.
            Enter raylib.
        </p>
        <p>The best part of using raylib, in my humble opinion is the awesomne ability to have total and complete granular control over the 
            projecct that you are working on. You can literal code yourself into each and every piece of logic or object that is in the game.
            Using a game engine someone else designed doesn't allow that. Instead you are getting THEM in your game. So lets talk about the 
            small little mock up I'm working on right now. Specifically the camera.

        <p>While it looks like absolutely nothing really, just a blue orb on a grid, the moment you touch the controls you will understand. 
            Almost like the sense of drunken stumbling you had the first time you experienced the awkward fixed camera in Resident Evil, I 
            managed to capture the sense of uncoordination and confusion that I want to be present in this game. I did that by coding each
            and every word, type, and function that was needed to do this. Could I have done this with the sleek and kick ass game engines 
            that are out there? Maybe, but this way it was guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>If you are working on a game, or any project that needs 2D or 3D graphics or even GUIs, give raylib a shot. I promise a few things.
            If you stick with it you'll learn some things, get the EXACT finished product that you want, and more importantly you'll have
            an absolute blast in the process.
