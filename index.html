            <div class="main-content-about">
                <p>Somewhere in the southern reaches of the United States, in one of the two Carolinas, you can find the last of a majestic, brilliant and absolutely drop dead handsome human known as Tim or as he has been whispered of in the dark corners of the internet, hazmat aka hazmat86 aka hazmat42 aka _hazmat aka __hazmat aka __hazmat__ aka JESUS CHRIST THEY GET IT! The name his wife uses is the most accurate though......a damn idiot.</p>
                <p>Linux (I use Arch btw...), low level programming, hardware hacking, cyber security and game design are where his interests lie. While he hopes to one day find regular paid work in one of the fields he is a rare breed that does this for fun and will whether or now he receives a check. </p>
                <p>Outside of tech he hopes to figure out why he loves writing in third person, digital photography and hopes to help people struggling with addiction, mental health issues and the criminal justice system. If you or someone you know is fighting don't hesitate to reach out to him.</p>
